# 🔐 AES Encryption & Decryption Tool

A simple Python-based tool for secure message encryption and decryption using **AES-128 (CBC mode)**. This project allows users to input any message and get encrypted output in Base64 format, which can later be decrypted using the same AES key.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔒 AES-128 symmetric encryption in CBC mode
- 📥 Accepts user input for encryption and decryption
- 📦 Base64 encoding for encrypted data and key sharing
- 🔁 Random IV generation for every encryption
- 🛡️ Secure key handling for temporary usage

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Language:** Python 3
- **Library:** [PyCryptodome](https://www.pycryptodome.org/) (for AES encryption)
